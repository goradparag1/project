        and, The teaching -learning materials include videos, large- size picure charts printed on durable flex

        materials are used not only with children in the village-level Learning Center but also as part of continuing
        education for farmers and women's group. <br> <br>
        Having created a foundation for English Teaching-Learning, we have now built on it and taken it to the next
        level.
        <strong> We have scripted, designed and produced a set of 19 animated video capsules along with a guide for
          facilitators.</strong>
        The systematic use of these educational materials will help meet the following objectives: introduce English
        sentences – speaking and writing; extend the learners’ English vocabulary – speaking and reading and enable
        the learners’ to use basic English in everyday life. Each of the 19 video capsules will be about 5 minutes in
        duration and will have simple 2-D animation with a voice-over. <br> <br>
        <strong>500 DVD copies of the video capsules are produced and distributed to the village-level Learning
          Centres in 9 districts of Maharashtra. In this way thousands of children will benefit from these
          teaching-learning materials.</strong> In addition, the materials will also be shared with a network of

      <div class="bold1k">KORKU TRIBAL LEARNING <br>
        PROJECT </div>

      <div class="text_44">

        Like all tribal in India the Korku tribals suffer poverty, lack of education, means for livelihood, social
        marginalization and other handicaps that reduce their living conditions to mere subsistence levels at great
        cost to the wellbeing they as human beings are entitled to. <br> <br>

        The key to their development lies in education beginning with their children. education at higher levels may
        or may not be accessible. But primary levels of education are crucial to build their lives dignity, developing
        their communication skills, empowering them to access further skills and higher levels of learning. <br> <br>

        Hence this project aims at strengthening the process of primary education which the government provides
        through zila parishad schools but which needs qualitative inputs in order that the Korku learner optimally
        benefits from the educational processes. <br> <br>

        Through the use of attractive charts developed for a rural and more so tribal context the contents of learning
        are made more familiar and intelligible to the tribal child. This charts cover keys syllabus: viz. English,
        Marathi and Math's basics along with Health and Social Education. <br> <br>

        The key insight into this supplementary educational support is to give Korku child an opportunity to learn and
        thus grow in confidence that such learning is possible at subsequent stages of its growth. <br> <br>

        The learning of the Korku child is of great significance to the family, the community and the clan. When the
        child learns the family looks at this breakthrough as an assertion of the worth of tribal culture, capacity
        for growth, confidence in the future. So when the Korku child learns Korku tribal society develops an identity
        of greater self-confidence, hope in the tribal capacity to cope with a changing world with all its diversity.
        There is strengthening of the human spirit to be oneself and to relate to other human beings without a sense
        of inferiority or of prejudice from ignorance. <br> <br>

        We see education as the prime process of moving ahead

      <div class="text_6a">

        This initiative comes from the Akshara Foundation for Arts and Learning‘s core cause to Bring the arts to
        children who are not otherwise exposed to the same. <br>

        At the Theatre, one of the many projects under this title is meant to create a space for learning through the
        experience of the theatre. The project is simple, bring children to the theatre! We also facilitate pre
        watching and post watching workshop to orient child to the theatre, as often they have not seen a play. This
        is to help open their eyes to look for a meaning, to be open to experience and spark their own imagination
        that the theatre helps fuel. In the post play workshop, we open up dialogues around individual perspective,
        how we look at things differently, how we feel differently and how we experience a moment as a community while
        in theatre. <br>

        The objective is an experience with and through the arts, learning is embedded in the experience itself. Art
        is not a vehicle to learn about worldly things, ours is an effort to give value to the form, to the art, to
        the experience of it. The learning is from what that experience does to mind, body and senses. <br>

        We are also working on curating children’s play at venues across the city, our calendar will run through
        2017-18. Our dream is to have no specific season of children’s theatre this may even encourage theatre
        companies to think alike and perhaps even convert more players to making works for children. <br>

        In the future, Arts for All will also bring community libraries, immersive experience with books, pottery and
        visual art engagements for children.

      <div class="text_81">

        Inspired by the film ‘Bajrangi Bhaijaan’, Being Bajrangi was project in association with Rann Neeti Strategic
        Consultants, to identify lost children in Mumbai and reconnect them with their families. Every day, thousands
        of children go missing in different parts of India. Some runway from home in search of better life, others are
        sent to work, and many just lose their way and are separated from their parents. The conditions of these
        children once they leave their home is miserable. They are suddenly all alone, away from familiar sights and
        sounds of their home towns. They are vulnerable to abuse and are more often than not mistreated and exploited.
        Circumstances harden them and its not long before many lose their innocence and tread on dangerous paths. For
        those who end up in a new city or state the condition is even worse as they have no idea of the language and
        have no one to approach for help. Several organisations in Mumbai work hard everyday to identify these
        children at railway stations and public places in an effort to provide them with some basic security and
        protection. These children are then produced before the child welfare committees to search for NGO’s that are
        able to offer them shelter, food and some cases education. The team behind the Being Bajrangi initiative
        worked closely with some of the institutions involved in child welfare, to trace the families of some of these
        missing children. Funding was provided to families from across the country who came to Mumbai so that these
        children could be reunited with their parents and relatives. Today, 51 children have been reunited with their
        families and are now enrolled in schools and other projects in their home towns
